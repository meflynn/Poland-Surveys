    "text": "These appendices contain supplementary information for the paper Supplementary Appendix for Outside Threats and Public Perceptions of the U.S. Military in Poland. Herein we provide a number of additional resources related to the project. First, we provide basic information about the survey and data collection procedures. Second, we provide some basic descriptive statistics and information to help readers better understand the data and the distribution of key variables and responses. Third, to save space in the primary manuscript we include all of the model tables for the project here. Fourth, we also include a number of additional figures to help communicate the results of our analysis. Finally, we include a number of diagnostic plots generated from the models we run. In general, we focus on a few specific types of plots and, where necessary, on key variables. For example, traceplots for multilevel multinomial logit models can quickly become both numerous and unwieldy in the confines of a PDF or printed document."

    "text": "Balance Tables\nTable 1 shows the balance of the predictor variables across the four treatment groups in the experiment. Most of the variables in our models are indicator variables, and so the numbers shown in the columns correspond to the number of respondents who chose a particular response for a particular question. For example, the number of people who respond that they identify as either Male or Female.\nThe value in the parentheses indicates the percentage of responses that fall into each of the four treatment categories. In general, we expect this value to fall close to 25% for each row.\nLast, the final column shows the total number of responses for each category/row.\nWe do not conduct a formal balance test, but this table helps us to ensure that the randomization procedure worked as intended. In general, we see most response-treatment groups falling at around the 25% mark, which is what we should expect if individuals were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment categories. We see more substantial deviations where the total number of observations for a given response is low. For example, with only 40 total respondents indicating that their primary income source was in the agricultural sector, small differences in the number of people who fall into each treatment group have a larger effect on the percentage value.\nThe final row shows the mean value and standard deviation (in parentheses) for the ideology score, which is the only ordered integer response variable we included in the survey. Since we mean-center this measure, each category should have a mean of approximately 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Balance table for predictors used in primary models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Group\n\n\n\n\nPredictor Level\nControl\nSecurity\nEconomic\nSecurity and Economic\nAll Groups\n\n\n\n\nGender\n\n\nMale\n273 (25.4%)\n270 (25.1%)\n267 (24.8%)\n265 (24.7%)\n1075\n\n\nFemale\n284 (24.1%)\n302 (25.7%)\n288 (24.5%)\n303 (25.7%)\n1177\n\n\nNone of the above\n0 (0%)\n1 (50%)\n1 (50%)\n0 (0%)\n2\n\n\nMinority\n\n\nNo\n456 (25.3%)\n455 (25.2%)\n449 (24.9%)\n442 (24.5%)\n1802\n\n\nYes\n84 (22.5%)\n94 (25.2%)\n92 (24.7%)\n103 (27.6%)\n373\n\n\nDecline to answer\n17 (21.5%)\n24 (30.4%)\n15 (19%)\n23 (29.1%)\n79\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nDecline to answer\n1 (20%)\n1 (20%)\n1 (20%)\n2 (40%)\n5\n\n\nHigher Education (Bachelor/Engineer)\n73 (23.2%)\n74 (23.5%)\n83 (26.3%)\n85 (27%)\n315\n\n\nHigher Education (Master’s degree or higher)\n148 (24.7%)\n161 (26.9%)\n148 (24.7%)\n142 (23.7%)\n599\n\n\nPrimary Education\n24 (34.8%)\n19 (27.5%)\n12 (17.4%)\n14 (20.3%)\n69\n\n\nSecondary Education\n238 (25%)\n240 (25.2%)\n240 (25.2%)\n234 (24.6%)\n952\n\n\nVocational School\n73 (23.2%)\n78 (24.8%)\n72 (22.9%)\n91 (29%)\n314\n\n\nAge\n\n\n18 to 24 years\n58 (28.6%)\n50 (24.6%)\n41 (20.2%)\n54 (26.6%)\n203\n\n\n25 to 34 years\n114 (26.6%)\n109 (25.5%)\n108 (25.2%)\n97 (22.7%)\n428\n\n\n35 to 44 years\n112 (23.7%)\n136 (28.8%)\n110 (23.3%)\n115 (24.3%)\n473\n\n\n45 to 54 years\n91 (23.6%)\n85 (22.1%)\n104 (27%)\n105 (27.3%)\n385\n\n\n55 to 64 years\n115 (23.3%)\n133 (27%)\n120 (24.3%)\n125 (25.4%)\n493\n\n\nAge 65 or older\n67 (24.6%)\n60 (22.1%)\n73 (26.8%)\n72 (26.5%)\n272\n\n\nIncome\n\n\n0 – 43 339\n109 (25.6%)\n98 (23%)\n111 (26.1%)\n108 (25.4%)\n426\n\n\n43 340 – 57 187\n85 (22.3%)\n112 (29.4%)\n82 (21.5%)\n102 (26.8%)\n381\n\n\n57 188 – 74 062\n113 (25.1%)\n115 (25.6%)\n104 (23.1%)\n118 (26.2%)\n450\n\n\n74 063 – 93 937\n105 (23.4%)\n120 (26.7%)\n118 (26.3%)\n106 (23.6%)\n449\n\n\n93 938 +\n114 (25.3%)\n110 (24.4%)\n120 (26.7%)\n106 (23.6%)\n450\n\n\nDecline to answer\n31 (31.6%)\n18 (18.4%)\n21 (21.4%)\n28 (28.6%)\n98\n\n\nIncome Source\n\n\nAgriculture\n8 (20%)\n15 (37.5%)\n6 (15%)\n11 (27.5%)\n40\n\n\nFull-time or contract work in the government or public sector\n57 (28.9%)\n49 (24.9%)\n46 (23.4%)\n45 (22.8%)\n197\n\n\nFull-time or contract work in the private sector\n304 (25.2%)\n300 (24.8%)\n301 (24.9%)\n303 (25.1%)\n1208\n\n\nOther sources\n56 (24.1%)\n65 (28%)\n54 (23.3%)\n57 (24.6%)\n232\n\n\nPension or retirement\n103 (22.5%)\n113 (24.7%)\n121 (26.5%)\n120 (26.3%)\n457\n\n\nSelf-employed (non-agricultural)\n29 (24.2%)\n31 (25.8%)\n28 (23.3%)\n32 (26.7%)\n120\n\n\nIdeology\n\n\nIdeology\n-0.024 (0.488)\n0.02 (0.499)\n0.006 (0.503)\n-0.003 (0.51)\n0 (0.5)"

All of the models were run using brms package version 2.19.0 [(Burkner2017?); (Burkner2018?); Stan2023].\n\nTable 2 shows the results of a multinomial logit model where we regress the outcome variable on the treatment group variable.\nTable 3 shows the results of our primary multinomial multilevel logit model. This model regresses the outcome response onto the treatment variable and several other predictor variables. Varying intercepts by province.\nTable 4 shows the results of our a multinomial multilevel logit model that regresses the outcome response onto the treatment variable and several other predictor variables. Varying intercepts by province and district.\nTable 5 shows the results of a model where we use the full six category response variable rather than the four category response used in our primary models.\nTable 6 shows the results of a model that replicates our primary multilevel model, but allows the effects of the treatment variable to vary across province.\nTable 7 changes the basic model specification slightly and uses the treatment group as the grouping term for the varying intercepts. We also include a variable indicating whether the respondent reported having personal contact with a U.S. service member, and we allow this effect to vary across treatment groups.\nTable 8 builds upon our primary model in Table 3 by adding a variable indicating whether the respondent reported having personal contact with a U.S. service member, and an interaction term between the contact variable and the treatment. We also include varying intercepts on province.\nTable 9 replicates the models from Table 8 but includes varying intercepts on both province and district.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Multinomial logistic regressions with treatment effects and outcome response.

    "text": "Effect of Distance on Expressed Attitudes\nHere we present a series of figures that contrast the posterior distribution samples from the two models predicting responses to the question regarding support for the construction of a new U.S. military facility in Poland. As we discuss in the manuscript, each survey participant is presented with one of four short vignettes and then asked about their level of support for the construction of a new U.S. military facility—first at a proposed distance of 100km and then a distance of 5km.\nFor each model we draw 500 sample values from the posterior distribution to generate a set of predicted probability values for the four possible outcomes responses/choices (i.e. Neutral, Oppose, Support, and Don’t know/Decline). To generate these values we set all of the predictor variables to their modal or mean values. We allow the treatment variables and grouping categories to take on the values observed in the data—for example, the first set of models includes four treatment categories and varying intercepts on the province grouping term, and so we end up with 64 (4 treatment groups \\(\\times\\) 16 provinces) groups of predicted probabilities corresponding to the 16 provinces in the data. When we calculate the contrasts we calculate the within-group (e.g. province) differences in the predicted probability values.\nOnce we have these predicted values for each of the two models, we then compare the posterior samples by subtracting the 100k posterior values from the 5k posterior values. Accordingly, positive values indicate that support is higher when the proposed distance is smaller, while smaller values indicate that support is stronger where the proposed distance is greater. For example, if the median posterior value for the “Support” outcome response is 0.80 for the 5km model and 0.60 for the 100k model, the resulting contrast value would be 0.20, which would tell us that the median predicted level for the support response is 20 percentage points higher for the 5k model.\nWe present a series of figures depicting these contrasts below. The dotplots depict the distribution of the posterior contrasts, with blue indicating observed values fall above 0 and red indicating that the observed values fall below 0. We also plot point intervals showing the median posterior contrast value, surrounded by 50% and 89% credible intervals. The dashed line represents 0. Finally, in each panel we also show the \\(Pr(Direction)\\) statistic—the probability that the median value falls above/below 0. This takes on a value in the range of \\([0.5, 1.0]\\).\n\nProvince-Level Models\nIn this section we present a series of figures plotting the posterior contrasts for each of the treatment group categories. Higher/more positive values indicate a higher probability of the given response in the 5km model and lower/more negative probability values indicate a higher probability of a given response in the 100km model.1\nIn general we observe similar patterns across all four panels, so rather than repeat ourselves we provide a general summary of the findings. Across all four panels we see that there is a slightly higher probability of a respondent responding with “Neutral” when the proposed distance is closer as compared to farther away. The posterior sample median generally ranges from approximately 0.02 to 0.09. Similarly, the \\(Pr(Direction)\\) statistic ranges from approximately 0.72 to 0.94, indicating fairly strong probabilities of observing a positive effect here.\nThough neutrality is also important, the remaining panels for Support and Opposition to the proposed U.S. military facility are perhaps more intuitively impactful. We see that across all four treatment groupings, respondents are less likely to support a new U.S. military facility when the proposed distance is closer (i.e. 5km) than further away (i.e. 100km). The probability of the observed difference is high, with all four groupings seeing 98–99% of the posterior contrasts falling below 0. Furthermore, the magnitude of the median contrast is fairly large, with differences in the predicted probability values falling between approximately 0.12 and 0.15 across the treatment groups.\nSimilarly, we observe fairly strong evidence that respondents are more likely to oppose a new U.S. military facility when the proposed distance is closer. We find \\(Pr(Direction)\\) statistics of approximately 0.98 or greater across all four groups, with median contrasts between approximately 0.10 and 0.12 in all groups.\nThese results are broadly consistent with a “NIMBYism” theme—people in Poland generally like U.S. military personnel and appear supportive of the security ties between the U.S. and Poland, but are less likely to support a new U.S. militay facility if that facility is going to be located close by.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Contrasts between distance for control group. 50% and 89% credible intervals shown around point estimate.

    "text": "District-Level Models\nThe following figures show the contrasts in predicted probabilities for the 5k and 100k distance questions, within treatment groups. The results presented in this section are from models that treat respondents as nested within districts, which are themselves nested within provinces. Accordingly, the models generating these figures include varying intercept terms for both province and district.\nAs in the previous section, we again find results largely consistent with a “NIMBY” framework. Respondents are generally less supportive of a U.S. military facility when the proposed distance for the facility’s location is 5km away as compared to 100km away. This pattern holds across all four treatment groups, with \\(Pr(Direction)\\) values around 0.98 or higher and median posterior contrasts in the 0.10 to 0.15 range in the “Support” and “Oppose” response groupings.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Contrasts between distance for control group. 50% and 89% credible intervals shown around point estimate.

Here we follow a similar procedure, presenting the contrasts in distance effects between those who report. having contact with U.S. military personnel and those who do not report and interpersonal contact with U.S. military personnel.

    "text": "Abstract\nOver the last decade, researchers have begun developing a better understanding of the social, political, and economic effects of foreign military deployments on their host environments. Most recently, research has explored the determinants of popular support and opposition to U.S. military deployments in host countries. However, researchers still have little understanding of the broader range of causal factors that shape civilians’ views of U.S. military personnel in host countries. This study focuses on Poland as a case with an exceptionally high external security threat and a U.S. military presence. Through a survey experiment, we find that individuals with the strongest views about the U.S. military do not move from their position of support by contextualizing a potential troop increase. In contrast, the views of “swing supporters” with weaker opinions of the U.S. military can change depending on the expected location of potential new U.S. forces."
