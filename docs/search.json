    "text": "These appendices contain supplementary information for the paper Supplementary Appendix for Outside Threats and Public Perceptions of the U.S. Military in Poland. Herein we provide a number of additional resources related to the project. First, we provide basic information about the survey and data collection procedures. Second, we provide some basic descriptive statistis and information to help readers better understand the data and the distribution of key variables and responses. Third, to save space in the primary manuscript we include all of the model tables for the project here. Fourth, we also include a number of additional figures to help communicate the results of our analysis. Finally, we include a number of diagnostic plots generated from the models we run. In general, we focus on a few specific types of plots and, where necessary, on key variables. For example, traceplots for multilevel multinomial logit models can quickly become both numerous and unwiedly in the confines of a PDF or printed document."

    "text": "Balance Tables\nTable 1 shows the balance of the predictor variables across the four treatment groups in the experiment. Most of the variables in our models are indicator variables, and so the numbers shown in the columns correspond to the number of respondents who chose a particular response for a particular question. For example, the number of people who respond that they identify as either Male or Female.\nThe value in the parentheses indicates the percentage of responses that fall into each of the four treatment categories. In general, we expect this value to fall close to 25% for each row.\nLast, the final column shows the total number of responses for each category/row.\nWe do not conduct a formal balance test, but this table helps us to ensure that the randomization procedure worked as intended. In general, we see most response-treatment groups falling at around the 25% mark, which is what we should expect if individuals were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment categories. We see more substantial deviations where the total number of observations for a given response is low. For example, with only 40 total respondents indicating that their primary income source was in the agricultural sector, small differences in the number of people who fall into each treatment group have a larger effect on the percentage value.\nThe final row shows the mean value and standard deviation (in parentheses) for the ideology score, which is the only ordered integer response variable we included in the survey. Since we mean-center this measure, each category should have a mean of approximately 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Balance table for predictors used in primary models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Group\n\n\n\n\nPredictor Level\nControl\nSecurity\nEconomic\nSecurity and Economic\nAll Groups\n\n\n\n\nGender\n\n\nMale\n273 (25.4%)\n270 (25.1%)\n267 (24.8%)\n265 (24.7%)\n1075\n\n\nFemale\n284 (24.1%)\n302 (25.7%)\n288 (24.5%)\n303 (25.7%)\n1177\n\n\nNone of the above\n0 (0%)\n1 (50%)\n1 (50%)\n0 (0%)\n2\n\n\nMinority\n\n\nNo\n456 (25.3%)\n455 (25.2%)\n449 (24.9%)\n442 (24.5%)\n1802\n\n\nYes\n84 (22.5%)\n94 (25.2%)\n92 (24.7%)\n103 (27.6%)\n373\n\n\nDecline to answer\n17 (21.5%)\n24 (30.4%)\n15 (19%)\n23 (29.1%)\n79\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nDecline to answer\n1 (20%)\n1 (20%)\n1 (20%)\n2 (40%)\n5\n\n\nHigher Education (Bachelor/Engineer)\n73 (23.2%)\n74 (23.5%)\n83 (26.3%)\n85 (27%)\n315\n\n\nHigher Education (Master’s degree or higher)\n148 (24.7%)\n161 (26.9%)\n148 (24.7%)\n142 (23.7%)\n599\n\n\nPrimary Education\n24 (34.8%)\n19 (27.5%)\n12 (17.4%)\n14 (20.3%)\n69\n\n\nSecondary Education\n238 (25%)\n240 (25.2%)\n240 (25.2%)\n234 (24.6%)\n952\n\n\nVocational School\n73 (23.2%)\n78 (24.8%)\n72 (22.9%)\n91 (29%)\n314\n\n\nAge\n\n\n18 to 24 years\n58 (28.6%)\n50 (24.6%)\n41 (20.2%)\n54 (26.6%)\n203\n\n\n25 to 34 years\n114 (26.6%)\n109 (25.5%)\n108 (25.2%)\n97 (22.7%)\n428\n\n\n35 to 44 years\n112 (23.7%)\n136 (28.8%)\n110 (23.3%)\n115 (24.3%)\n473\n\n\n45 to 54 years\n91 (23.6%)\n85 (22.1%)\n104 (27%)\n105 (27.3%)\n385\n\n\n55 to 64 years\n115 (23.3%)\n133 (27%)\n120 (24.3%)\n125 (25.4%)\n493\n\n\nAge 65 or older\n67 (24.6%)\n60 (22.1%)\n73 (26.8%)\n72 (26.5%)\n272\n\n\nIncome\n\n\n0 – 43 339\n109 (25.6%)\n98 (23%)\n111 (26.1%)\n108 (25.4%)\n426\n\n\n43 340 – 57 187\n85 (22.3%)\n112 (29.4%)\n82 (21.5%)\n102 (26.8%)\n381\n\n\n57 188 – 74 062\n113 (25.1%)\n115 (25.6%)\n104 (23.1%)\n118 (26.2%)\n450\n\n\n74 063 – 93 937\n105 (23.4%)\n120 (26.7%)\n118 (26.3%)\n106 (23.6%)\n449\n\n\n93 938 +\n114 (25.3%)\n110 (24.4%)\n120 (26.7%)\n106 (23.6%)\n450\n\n\nDecline to answer\n31 (31.6%)\n18 (18.4%)\n21 (21.4%)\n28 (28.6%)\n98\n\n\nIncome Source\n\n\nAgriculture\n8 (20%)\n15 (37.5%)\n6 (15%)\n11 (27.5%)\n40\n\n\nFull-time or contract work in the government or public sector\n57 (28.9%)\n49 (24.9%)\n46 (23.4%)\n45 (22.8%)\n197\n\n\nFull-time or contract work in the private sector\n304 (25.2%)\n300 (24.8%)\n301 (24.9%)\n303 (25.1%)\n1208\n\n\nOther sources\n56 (24.1%)\n65 (28%)\n54 (23.3%)\n57 (24.6%)\n232\n\n\nPension or retirement\n103 (22.5%)\n113 (24.7%)\n121 (26.5%)\n120 (26.3%)\n457\n\n\nSelf-employed (non-agricultural)\n29 (24.2%)\n31 (25.8%)\n28 (23.3%)\n32 (26.7%)\n120\n\n\nIdeology\n\n\nIdeology\n-0.024 (0.488)\n0.02 (0.499)\n0.006 (0.503)\n-0.003 (0.51)\n0 (0.5)"

All of the models were run using brms package version 2.19.0 [Bürkner (2017); Bürkner (2018); Stan2023].\n\nTable 2 shows the results of a multinomial logit model where we regress the outcome variable on the treatment group variable.\nTable 3 shows the results of our primary multinomial multilevel logit model. This model regresses the outcome response onto the treatment variable and several other predictor variables. Varying intercepts by province.\nTable 4 shows the results of our a multinomial multilevel logit model that regresses the outcome response onto the treatment variable and several other predictor variables. Varying intercepts by province and district.\nTable 5 shows the results of a model where we use the full six category response variable rather than the four category response used in our primary models.\nTable 6 shows the results of a model that replicates our primary multilevel model, but allows the effects of the treatment variable to vary across province.\nTable 7 changes the basic model specification slightly and uses the treatment group as the grouping term for the varying intercepts. We also include a variable indicating whether the respondent reported having personal contact with a U.S. service member, and we allow this effect to vary across treatment groups.\nTable 8 builds upon our primary model in Table 3 by adding a variable indicating whether the respondent reported having personal contact with a U.S. service member, and an interaction term between the contact variable and the treatment. We also include varying intercepts on province.\nTable 9 replicates the models from Table 8 but includes varying intercepts on both province and district.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Multinomial logistic regressions with treatment effects and outcome response.

    "text": "Abstract\nOver the last decade, researchers have begun developing a better understanding of the social, political, and economic effects of foreign military deployments on their host environments. Most recently, research has explored the determinants of popular support and opposition to U.S. military deployments in host countries. However, researchers still have little understanding of the broader range of causal factors that shape civilians’ views of U.S. military personnel in host countries. This study focuses on Poland as a case with an exceptionally high external security threat and a U.S. military presence. Through a survey experiment, we find that individuals with the strongest views about the U.S. military do not move from their position of support by contextualizing a potential troop increase. In contrast, the views of “swing supporters” with weaker opinions of the U.S. military can change depending on the expected location of potential new U.S. forces."
